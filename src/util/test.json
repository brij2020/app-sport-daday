                    "Article": "Nathan Lyon dragged Australia back into the Border-Gavaskar Test series on the second morning of the Delhi Test with a sensational spell of spin bowling that left India reeling at 88/4, a good 175 away from the visitors' first-innings total. The veteran offspinner took each of the four Indian wickets to fall in a spell that read 9-1-21-4. India were left looking to Ravindra Jadeja and Virat Kohli to cut into the deficit on a track offering significant turn and uneven bounce.\n\nLyon struck in his second over of the day when he had KL Rahul defending with his bat and pad together. It's a technique that will no longer cut it in this era of DRS and even a hopeful review from the Indian vice-captain didn't save him. Until then, Rahul and opening partner Rohit Sharma had begun rather confidently, especially against a relatively less potent spell first up by Pat Cummins. Rahul, growing in confidence, even stepped out to launch Matthew Kuhnemann over long-on for six.\n\nOnce Lyon had his breakthrough, he ran riot. He then castled the Indian captain with one that went with the angle and kept a touch low. What was great about the dismissal was that Lyon beat an in-form and assured-looking batter in the air and had him stuck on the crease with his immaculate length. Then he removed Cheteshwar Pujara for a duck in his 100th Test. Pujara, like Rahul, defended with his bat and pad close together and was sent on his way after a review found that the ball had hit pad before bat. Incidentally, Pujara had survived a similar shout in the previous over when Australia opted against a review.",

The Australian opener took a blow to his arm and also copped a hit on his helmet off a Mohammed Siraj delivery on the opening day of the fixture.\n\nUsman Khawaja, Warner's opening partner, admitted on Friday that that left-hander was 'weary'and that the medical staff would take a call on his further participation in the Test. Ahead of the second day's play, it has been confirmed that Warner will take no further part in the fixture due to suffering the concussion.\n\nThis marks a swift return to the side for Renshaw, who lost his spot to Travis Head for the ongoing fixture after Australia's heavy defeat in Nagpur where he made 0 (1) and 2 (7). Since Renshaw will be a like-for-like replacement, he cannot bowl in the Test.",

They are still in the arrears by 175 and there are no easy runs to come. Can they somehow tire this four-man attack? We'll know after Lunch!\n\nFour for Lyon as Iyer falls\n\nBut this is a wicket for Peter Handscomb, the short-leg fielder. Iyer has middled this as he looks to work one to the legside and Handscomb uses all of his body and his presence of mind to hold on. Iyer as well as the Indian dressing room looks shell-shocked.",

In a traditionally conservative country, it was not the sort of concept that would normally have found fertile territory. Yet when Jason Bowen, a cricket manager tasked with overseeing the talent pipeline, suggested that Eastern Province add two of their women to the men's academy, it was welcomed.\n\n\"There was no resistance in-house - instead there was consensus that this is a breathe of fresh air,\" recalls Christo Esau, who was coaching the academy at the time. \"They were both playing for the EP women's team, so why not? That was more the conversation. EP have always been an organisation who develop. Their love for cricket was the deal clincher.",
